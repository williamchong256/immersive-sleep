## Instructions

### Note: Each step should be done in a separate terminal

Step 1: backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Step 2: frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm install --global expo-cli
expo start
```

If the tab icons fail to load, try running expo with the Metro bundler cache cleared.

`expo start -c`

## Before Pushing Code

Step 1: ensure your code passes tests and style

`npm run test`

Step 2: if your code fails style, you can try to automatically fix it

`npx eslint '**/*.js' '**/*.jsx' --fix`

## Setup ESP8266 board

The ESP8266 allows us to communicate wirelessly with rasberry pi terminal through TCP/IP protocol

Step 1: Install Arduino IDE

Step 2: Add the following ESP8266 Board Manager Address in Preference, Additional Board URL

`http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`

Step 3: Under board manager, search for esp8266 library by ESP8266 Community and install it

Step 4: Upload the sketch to the breakout board (NodeMCU, or Arduino + ESP8266)

Step 5: Use HTTP GET request to get SpO2 and heart rate readings from the board
  below is an example written in python

```python
import requests
print(requests.get('The ESP8266's local IP Address').text)
```
