MAX30100 
    It is a Pulse Oximeter and heart-rate sensor for wearable health
    It offers greater expandability than the PulseSensor module 
        The output led voltage can be adjusted, offering greater penetration 
        The sample rate can also be adjusted 
        It has builtin ambient light cancellation, which is pretty amazing  
        The module has a 16-deep FIFO (you can do some hacking with the original data) 
    This module uses I2C communication 
        The module does not natively supporting arduino. Some documents indicate that removing the 4.7k pull up resistors at SCL and SDA pin will work 
        The module works fine with NodeMCU and STM32 
    This module measures SpO2 and temperature. The library MAX30100.h offeres functions to directly access SpO2 and temperature
